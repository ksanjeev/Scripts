</table><a name="1083188"></a><p>When Server Administrator starts, it first determines if the Windows Server 2003 R2 IPMI driver is enabled. If enabled, then Server Administrator uses the Windows Server 2003 R2 IPMI driver to provide its IPMI-based functionality. If the Windows Server 2003 R2 IPMI driver is not enabled, Server Administrator uses its own internal IPMI support to provide its IPMI-based functionality. For Server Administrator, it is recommended that you use the Windows Server 2003 R2 IPMI driver instead of the internal IPMI support. If your system is running Windows Server 2003 R2 or Windows Storage Server R2, it is recommended that after you install or upgrade Server Administrator, you also install the optional Hardware Management component of R2.</p>
<a name="1083262"></a><p>To install the Windows Server 2003 R2 IPMI driver on PowerEdge <i>x8xx </i>systems, perform the following additional step: </p>

To restart the service, you can either manually restart the service or reboot the system.</p>
<a name="1082749"></a><p>At a later date, if you uninstall the Windows Server 2003 R2 IPMI driver either directly by manually uninstalling it or by uninstalling the Hardware Management component (which will uninstall the driver), you must restart the <b>DSM SA Data Manager</b> service so that Server Administrator can switch over from using the Windows Server 2003 R2 IPMI driver to using its own internal IPMI support. To restart the service, you can either manually restart the service or reboot the system.</p>
<a name="1066971"></a><h3> Digital Certificates
</h3>
<a name="1066972"></a><p>All Server Administrator packages for Microsoft are digitally signed with a Dell&nbsp;certificate that helps guarantee the integrity of the installation packages. If these packages are repackaged, edited, or manipulated in other ways, the digital signature will be invalidated. This manipulation results in an unsupported installation package and the Prerequisite Checker will not allow you to install&nbsp;the software.</p>

</h3>
<a name="1067554"></a><p>You must have Administrator privileges. </p>
<a name="1067555"></a><p>If you want to use supporting agents for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), you must install the operating system support for the SNMP standard before or after you install Server Administrator.

</table><a name="1068061"></a><h4> Prerequisite Checker</h4>
<a name="1071811"></a><p>The setup program (<b>setup.exe</b>) will start the Prerequisite Checker program. The setup program is located in the <b>\srvadmin\Windows</b> directory on the <i>Dell PowerEdge Installation and Server Management</i> CD. The&nbsp;Prerequisite Checker program examines the prerequisite requirements for software features without launching the actual installation. This program displays a status window that provides information about your system's hardware and software that might affect the installation and operation of software features. </p>
<a name="1076415"></a><p>The Prerequisite Checker displays three types of messages: informational, warning, and error&nbsp;messages.</p>
<a name="1068065"></a><p>An informational message describes a condition of which you should be aware. It does not prevent a feature from being installed.</p>
<a name="1076780"></a><p>A warning message describes a condition that prevents a software product from being installed during Express installation. It is recommended that you resolve the condition causing the warning before proceeding with the installation of that software. If you decide to continue, you can select and install the software using the Custom installation. For example, if an Intel network interface card (NIC) is not detected on the system, you will see the following message:</p>
<a name="1073505"></a>
<p class="screenindent">An Intel(R) NIC was not detected on this system. This will disable 
the "Express" installation of the Intel(R) SNMP Agent.
</p>
<a name="1073507"></a>
<p class="screenindent">Use the "Custom" installation setup type later during installation to 
select this feature if you have an Intel(R) NIC installed.
</p>
<a name="1072334"></a><p>An error message describes a condition of which you should be aware that prevents the software feature from being installed. You must resolve the condition causing the error before proceeding with the installation of the software feature. If you do not resolve the issue, the software feature will not be installed.</p>
<a name="1077874"></a><p>You can run the prerequisite check silently by running <span class="screen">RunPreReqChecks.exe /s</span>	  from the <b>srvadmin\windows\PreReqChecker</b> directory. For further details see "<a href="prereqch.htm#1053126">Prerequisite Checker</a>."</p>

</h3>
<a name="1081940"></a><p>The Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) provides the ability to return a system to its fully working condition after a failed installation. MSI does this by maintaining an undo operation for every Standard Action it performs during an install, upgrade, or uninstall. This operation includes restoration of deleted or overwritten files, registry keys, and other resources. Windows temporarily saves any files that it deletes or overwrites during the course of an installation or removal, so they can be restored if necessary, which is a type of rollback. After a successful installation finishes, Windows deletes all of the temporary backup files.</p>
<a name="1064049"></a><p>In addition to the rollback of MSI Standard Actions, the Dell OpenManage library also has the ability to undo commands listed in the INI file for each application if a rollback occurs. All files that are modified by the Dell OpenManage installation actions will be restored to their original state if a rollback occurs. </p>
<a name="1064050"></a><p>When the MSI engine is going through the installation sequence, it ignores all actions that are scheduled as rollback actions. If a Custom Action, MSI Standard Action, or a Dell OpenManage installation action fails, then a rollback starts. </p>
<a name="1064983"></a><p>An installation cannot be rolled back once it has finished; transacted installation is only intended as a safety net that protects the system during an installation session. If you want to remove an installed application, for instance, you should simply uninstall that application.</p>

</h3>
<a name="1070394"></a><p>MSI patches and updates provided by vendors must be applied to the original vendor MSI packages provided. If you intentionally or accidentally repackage an MSI package, or make changes to it directly, patches and updates might fail. MSI packages must not be repackaged; doing so changes the feature structure and GUIDs, which break any provided patches or updates. When it is necessary to make any changes to a vendor-provided MSI package, a <b>.mst</b> transform file should always be used to do so.</p>
<a name="1057503"></a><h3> Windows Installer Logging
</h3>
<a name="1081694"></a><p>Windows includes a registry-activated logging service to help diagnose Windows Installer issues. To&nbsp;enable this logging service during a silent install, open the registry with <b>Regedt32.exe</b> and create the following path and keys: </p>
<a name="1081695"></a><p><span class="screen">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer<br>Reg_SZ: Logging<br>Value: voicewarmup </span></p>
<a name="1081696"></a><p>The letters in the value field can be in any order. Each letter turns on a different logging mode. Each letter's actual function is as follows for MSI version 3.1: </p>

To include the v option, specify "/l*v".</p>
<a name="1081698"></a><p>Once activated, you can find the log files that are generated in your %TEMP% directory. Some log files generated in this directory are:</p>

Specify a job folder into which to import it. You might need to modify the <b>Run Script</b> and <b>Copy File</b> tasks to match your deployment environment. When complete, you can then schedule your job to run on the supported Dell systems that are managed from within your Altiris Deployment Solution.</p>
