<a name="1046101"></a><p>This guide contains information to help you install Dell OpenManage&#153; software on management stations and their managed systems. A <i>managed system</i> is a system that has supported instrumentation or agents installed that allow the system to be discovered and polled for status. A&nbsp;<i>management station</i> is used to remotely manage one or more managed systems from a central location. See <a href="intro.htm#1052269">Figure&nbsp;1-1</a> for a view of a management station and its managed systems. In addition, this guide provides information and instructions for configuring your systems before and during a deployment or upgrade. The following topics are&nbsp;covered:</p>

</ul><a name="1046215"></a><h3> Systems Management Software Overview
</h3>
<a name="1046216"></a><p>Dell OpenManage systems management software is a suite of application programs for Dell&#153;&nbsp;PowerEdge&#153; systems and some Dell PowerVault&#153; systems. This software enables you to manage your systems with proactive monitoring, diagnosis, notification, and remote access. </p>
<a name="1051819"></a><p>Each system managed by Dell OpenManage systems management software is called a managed system. You can manage a managed system either locally or remotely. Software applications that you may install onto the managed systems include Dell OpenManage Server Administrator (which includes the Storage Management Service, Diagnostic Service, and the Server Administrator Web server), SNMP agents for Intel&#174; or Broadcom network interface cards (NICs), and remote access controller (RAC) software.</p>
<a name="1051809"></a><p>A management station can be used to remotely configure and maintain one or more managed systems from a central location. Dell OpenManage IT Assistant and the other management station applications enable you to manage from one to thousands of managed systems. For instance, a management station can be used to deploy images of physical media to virtual media at many managed systems.</p>

<a name="1051590"></a><p>IT Assistant is a Web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a central point of access to monitor and manage systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN). By providing a comprehensive view across the enterprise, IT Assistant can increase system uptime, reduce repetitive tasks, and prevent interruption during critical business operations. </p>
<a name="1051577"></a><p>Using IT Assistant, you can:</p>
<ul><li><a name="1046752"></a>Identify the groups of systems that you want to manage remotely<br><br></li>
<li><a name="1046753"></a>Consolidate your view of all systems, providing a central launch point for systems&nbsp;management<br><br></li>
<li><a name="1046754"></a>Create alert filters and actions that will automatically notify you when system uptime is&nbsp;affected<br><br></li>
<li><a name="1046756"></a>Create custom enterprise-wide reports that show the status of each system, including switches, storage devices, BIOS, firmware, and driver versions<br><br></li>
<li><a name="1051268"></a>Create customized tasks that allow you to coordinate configuration management across the entire enterprise, including performing software updates, shutdown and wakeup, and command line execution<br><br></li>

SUU is a dual-purpose application and is easy to use. You can use SUU to update your PowerEdge server or to view the updates available for any system listed in the Repository.</p>
<a name="1058172"></a><p>SUU facilitates change management by allowing you to update system components using an application that compares the version of currently installed components with updated components packaged on a CD and stored in a Repository. A full session of SUU would typically run an inventory of installed components and their versions, provide a comparison report between what is installed currently on the system and what the latest component versions are in the Repository, and leave to you the decision whether to apply the Dell component System Update Set to update the system or not. You can customize the packages you want to upgrade. You can rollback newer versions of components on your system to the corresponding component version contained on the <i>Dell PowerEdge Updates</i> CD. SUU is delivered on separate CDs for Microsoft Windows and Linux.</p>
