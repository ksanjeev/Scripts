Revision history for Perl module Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.

2.15 September 18 2005 - Minor

	! Changed OLE container stream name from "Book" to "Workbook"
	  for compatibility with some third party apps.
      Thanks Wieland Pusch and Kevin McMahon.

	! Fixed bug that caused all worksheets to be selected in
	  OpenOfficeOrg causing strange linking of data between
	  Worksheets. Thanks  M. Brodbelt. See
	  http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=14094
	  http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=52955

	! Changed file creation from end of program to the start of
	  program in order to avoid race conditions and extra file
	  creation on VMS.

    + Added optional user supplied results for formulas as a
      workaround for uncalcuated values in some non-Excel apps.
      Added formula_result.pl example of above.



2.14 May 9 2005 - Minor

    ! Fixed handling of Unicode font names.


2.13 April 20 2005 - Minor

    ! Made it a fatal error to use a merged format in a non-
      merged cell (and vice-versa). This is a temporary measure
      to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot
      until the Format.pm code can be refactored.

    + Add 01_merge_formats.t test for above.

    + Added date_time tests.


2.12 March 22 2005 - Minor

    + Added further Unicode support. The following methods now
      handle uft8 in perl 5.8:
      add_worksheet()
      set_header()
      set_footer()
      set_font()
      set_num_format()

    + Added unicode_cyrillic.pl example.

    + Added 01_add_worksheet.t test.


2.11 September 30 2004 - Minor

    - Removed undocumented date_time handling from write() to
      avoid potential false matches.

    + Added add_write_handler() method to allow users to add
      their own data handlers to write().

    + Added 4 write_handler examples.


2.10 September 23 2004 - Major

    + Added chart support via external templates.
      Added Chart.pm and add_chart_ext() method to Workbook object.
      Added /charts directory with examples and documentation

    + Added write_date_time() worksheet method for writing dates
      and times in Excel date format.
      Added date_time.pl example.

    + Added automatic Unicode handling via utf8 in perl 5.8 and
      later. Thanks Mark Fowler.
      Added several unicode_*.pl examples in different encodings.
      Thanks to Sean Burke for the sample encodings.

    + Added write_to_scalar.pl example in order to answer frequently
      asked question about writing an Excel file to a scalar.


2.04 August 18 2004 - Minor

    ! Fixed handling of Euro symbol in num_format() strings.

    ! Renamed the Excel 5 style merge() format to the more correct
      center_across(). Updated examples accordingly.

      merged ranges.

    + Fixed handling of doubled double quotes in formula strings.
      Thanks to a tip from merlyn.

    + The 2.xx versions are now compatible with MS Access. Removed
      statements to the contrary.

    ! Fixed bug that prevented column outlines from displaying.
      Thanks to Marc Rosenthal.

    ! Enhanced add_worksheet() name checking to exclude case-

      Thanks to David Dyck.

    + Minor changes to demo.pl merge5.pl and the html docs.


2.01 May 27 2004 - Major

    This version is a MAJOR revision to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel. The
    format of the Excel file that it produces has been updated from
    Excel 5 to Excel 97. This allows support for long, 32k character
    strings and Unicode.

    DUE TO THE MAJOR INTERNAL CHANGES IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU TEST
    THIS UPGRADE FULLY BEFORE DEPLOYING IT.

    Also note that this version can be 1.5 to 2 times slower than
    previous versions and the write_comment() method has been
    temporarily removed. These issues will be fixed in later releases.


    + Changed the default Excel format to Excel 97.

    + Added support for strings up to 32767 character.

    + Added support for Unicode strings.

    + Improved speed in relation to pre-release versions.
      However, it is still slower than the 1.xx versions.

    + Improved OpenOffice.org support.

    + Added more examples: diag_border.pl, indent.pl,
      unicode.pl, unicode_japan.pl, unicode_list.pl

    + Changed the distro dir structure.

    - Temporarily removed write_comment() support since the Excel 5
      version isn't compatible with Excel 97+.


1.01 May 24 2004 - Minor

    ! Small non-bug fix to write_comment().


0.43 April 28 2004 - Minor

      show up in OpenOffice.org.

    ! Fixed bug when using IO::Sclalar object as a filehandle.
      Thanks to Kyle R. Burton and David Robins.

    ! Fixed minor formula parser bug.
      Thanks Michael Braig

    ! Fixed handling of column sizing for widths less than 1
      unit (again). Thanks to Rubio (again).

    ! Failed new() returns undef instead of croak()ing as per docs.


0.41 April 24 2003 - Minor

    + Added facility for adding outlines to worksheets. Added
      outline.pl example. Thanks to Franco Venturi.

    + Moved write_comment() code into the core modules. It is now
      possible to write cell comments.

    + Added option to return a slice from the sheets() method.

    + Added link to latest Excel97 pre-release.
      http://freshmeat.net/projects/writeexcel/#comment-24916

    ! Changed, once more, the handling of temp files to avoid several
      file closing bugs. Thanks to many.

    ! Fixed handling of column sizing for widths less than 1 unit.
      Thanks Rubio.

    ! Renamed addworksheet() and addformat() to add_worksheet()
      and add_format() for consistency with other method names.
      Older names are supported but deprecated.


0.40 December 21 2002 - Minor

    ! Fixed internal sheet indexing in formulas on some platforms.
      This caused multi-sheet workbooks with formulas to crash.
      Thanks Troy Daniels.

    ! Fixed non-lexical filehandles to prevent problems in
      multi-threaded environments.
      Thanks Ning Xie.


0.39 September 23 2002 - Minor

    + Added the set_codepage() workbook method. This is mainly to
      prevent a bug that caused Gnumeric to crash but it is also
      useful for people working with non ascii chars on the Macintosh.
      Thanks Jody Goldberg.

    ! Fixed the non-deletion of temporary files. Users of version
      0.38 should probably clean up their tmp dirs manually.
      Thanks Pierre Laplante.

    ! Changed default handling of set_fg_color and set_bg_color from
      what Excel expected to what everyone else expected. Setting the
      fill colour of a cell should now be more intuitive.

    + Replaced the merge_cells() method with the merge_range() method.
      This is mainly to prevent the Excel 97 crashing bug that occurs
      when merge_cells() is used correctly. It also provide a simpler
      interface to the merge feature. Updated merge example programs.

    ! Refactored the error raising mechanism for formulas. The source
      of errors should now be clearer.

      file close.

    + Added option to hide row with the set_row() method

    + Added more examples: merge4.pl, merge5.pl, sendmail.pl and
      repeat.pl

      directory. Thanks Bob Mackay Andre de Bruin
